Here is a sample `README.md` file for your project that explains the setup and usage:

---

# Video Platform Project

This is a video platform application that allows users to watch videos, comment, like, and dislike them. It includes video streaming, comment functionality, and user interaction features like likes/dislikes.

## Features

- Video playback
- Add and delete comments
- Like and dislike functionality
- Fetch and display videos from an API
- User authentication (optional, not implemented in this example)

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-platform.git
cd video-platform
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The backend is a Node.js Express application that interacts with MongoDB to store video data, comments, likes, and dislikes.

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key (if authentication is implemented)
```

#### Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:3000`. The backend API will handle video data, comments, and like/dislike functionality.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a React-based application that fetches data from the backend API and displays videos, handles user interactions, and allows users to comment, like, or dislike videos.

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Start the Frontend Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3001`. The frontend will interact with the backend API to display videos and handle user interactions.

---

## Usage

### 1. Viewing Videos

Once the app is running, navigate to the frontend application (`http://localhost:3001`), where you'll see a list of available videos. Clicking on a video will take you to the video page where you can:

- Watch the video
- Like or Dislike the video
- View and add comments

### 2. Liking/Disliking a Video

On the video page, you can click the **Like** or **Dislike** buttons to increase the likes or dislikes for the video. These counts will be reflected in real time.

### 3. Commenting on Videos

Users can add comments by typing a message in the comment section and clicking **Add Comment**. All comments will be stored and displayed below the video.

### 4. Managing Comments

You can also delete comments if you have the appropriate permissions.

---

## API Routes (Backend)

### Video Routes

- `GET /api/videos`: Fetch all videos.
- `GET /api/video/:id`: Fetch a single video by ID.
- `POST /api/video/:id/like`: Increment the like count for the video.
- `POST /api/video/:id/dislike`: Increment the dislike count for the video.

### Comment Routes

- `GET /api/comments/:id`: Fetch all comments for a video by ID.
- `POST /api/comment`: Add a new comment to a video.
- `DELETE /api/comment/:id`: Delete a comment by ID.
- `PUT /api/comment/:id`: Update a comment by ID.
